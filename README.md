“Overdue”
==================

Overdue is a “Task List” iOS app that I created for an assignment in my Code Coalition iOS Beginner Bootcamp class.

I also added some extra credit functionality that I figured out on my own:<br><br>
1)  Customized tableView cell imageView with icons and modified background colors.<br>
2)  Added UISwitch option for user to toggle Completion status on DetailTaskViewController and EditTaskViewController<br>
3)  Customized tableView accessoryView + triggered button action<br>
4)  Added launch image<br>
5)  Added app icon<br>
